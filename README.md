# Kangrat
A schema-based website builder based off of Node.js. Small and fast (like a kangaroo rat)
## Install
This is too edgy to be put on NPM, just download this and run `npm install` in the downloaded directory
## Demo
run `npm install && npm link`

then run `kangrat --help` for help.

## Want to help?:
Look at the wiki on Github for more info.
## Example project:
Look in the repository's /test-projects/Sample for a sample save file, and /test-projects/SampleBuild for the output of Sample (I added the index.html page to save time)
### Credits
The BasePage.html pulls from the [nanoajax library](https://github.com/yanatan16/nanoajax)
