# Kangrat
A schema-based website builder based off of Node.js. Small and fast (like a kangaroo rat)
## Install
This is too edgy to be put on NPM, just download this and run `npm install` in the downloaded directory
## Demo
run `npm install && npm link`

then run `kangrat --help` for help.

*When making a site, make sure your site's kangratsave.json is legit by checking against kangratschema.json in the repo 
(in vscode just add a "$schema" in your json and set it to the kangratschema.json file's URL)

## Example project:
Look in the repository's /demo/kangratsave.json for a sample save file
### Credits
The basepage.html pulls from the [nanoajax library](https://github.com/yanatan16/nanoajax)

### Versioning
I nuked this repo but didn't change the version number because:
1. nobody was using it
2. I like round numbers
however, if you must know, changes include EVERYTHING, and a UI is coming soon.
