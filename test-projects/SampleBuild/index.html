		<h1>This is an index page for the Kangrat sample</h1>
		<h2>Note that Kangrat by itself does not create an index page, which explains this ugliness</h2>
		<h3>Pages (these were created by Kangrat using the extremely ugly default theme)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="./blog.html?KangratData=data/blog/demo.json">A demo</a></li>
			<li><a href="./blog.html?KangratData=data/blog/demo1.json">Yet another demo</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each page includes an &lt;input&gt; element, because kangrat can use default HTML elements
			along with a &lt;google-youtube&gt; web component because kangrat can be customized
		</p>
		<h3>Want more info?</h3>

			Kangrat is a small and fast static website generator written in Node.js. 
			It is based on schemas, and data, with a focus on extensibility with web components
